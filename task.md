# Task: "Refined Structuralist" Redesign of Flowtab.Pro

Pivot from "Industrial Cyberpunk" to a cleaner, "Refined Structuralist" aesthetic. Focus on precision, legibility, and high-end editorial layouts. Eliminate the "alien" vibe.

## Design Philosophy
- **Tone**: "Architectural Precision". Less sci-fi, more high-end engineering tool.
- **Visuals**: Strict grids, beautiful typography, subtle noise, high contrast black/white with controlled accents.
- **Typography**: `Instrument Sans` (Headings) + `Geist Mono` (Code/Data).
- **Chaos Level**: Low. Organized.

## Immediate Subtasks
- [ ] **Reset Design System**: Update `globals.css`. Remove heavy cyber effects. Install `Instrument Sans`.
- [ ] **Generate Assets**: Create a subtle, high-quality "Drafting Grid" or "Noise Gradient" background.
- [ ] **Simplify Header**: Clean lines, no "cyber" brackets.
- [ ] **Rebuild Hero**: Focus on a "Command Center" search interface. Strong typography.
- [ ] **Clean Cards**: Remove neon glows. Use 1px borders and refined spacing.
- [ ] **Rationalize Footer**: Simple, columnar, grid-based.

## Completed
- [x] Identify and fix incorrect GitHub links (previous phase).
